You can download the dataset from here...https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/data

Here we compare two benchmarks ANN architectures in  classificaton of toxic comments on social media.
We use CONV1D and LSTM for handling comments sequences and figure out their performance.
